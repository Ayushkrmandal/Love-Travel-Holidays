This is my 1st Task of my Summer Internship In prodigy Infotech 


In this Project I have created an interactive navigation  menu that shows underline bar under the navigation bar menu item when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. Used HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as showing the underline bar under the menu item of navigation bar of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.
